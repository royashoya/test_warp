Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Python UUID generator script with the following features:

Features:

1. Multiple UUID Types:
•  UUID1: MAC address and timestamp-based
•  UUID4: Random (most commonly used)
•  UUID3: MD5 hash-based (requires namespace and name)
•  UUID5: SHA-1 hash-based (requires namespace and name)
2. Two Modes of Operation:
•  Command-line mode: For quick generation with parameters
•  Interactive mode: User-friendly menu-driven interface
3. Flexible Options:
•  Generate single or multiple UUIDs
•  Save output to file
•  Choose namespace for UUID3/UUID5 (DNS, URL, OID, X500)

Usage Examples:
# Generate a single random UUID (default)
python3 uuid_generator.py

# Generate 5 random UUIDs
python3 uuid_generator.py -c 5

# Generate timestamp-based UUID
python3 uuid_generator.py -t 1

# Generate hash-based UUID with custom name
python3 uuid_generator.py -t 5 -n "myproject" -c 3

# Save UUIDs to file
python3 uuid_generator.py -c 10 -o my_uuids.txt

# Run in interactive mode
python3 uuid_generator.py -interface

The script is now ready to use and provides a flexible way to generate UUIDs based on various user requirements. The interactive mode is particularly useful for users who prefer a guided interface, while the command-line options are perfect for automation and scripting.
